This is a simple javascript calculator
It performs basic functionality of addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.
It: 
    *clears the display with the AC button.
    *deletes the last entered digit with the DEL button.
    *automatically divides display by 100 with the % button.
    *explicitly computes the result of the operation with the = button.
The calculator handles a pair of operands with one operator at a time that implicitly computes and returns the result.
If the calculator display is not cleared, the returned result is used as first operand of the next calculation.
